## DuelAdapters

### Motivation

Adapters has been very popular methods for Parameter Efficient FineTining. Here is a different experiment that have been done here, where the motivation is to combine self-supervised and supervised finetuning and see how robust it is than simple fine-tuning. 

#### Todo
Right now duel adapters are going through lot of issues in not producing the desired outputs. Hence some todos to work more on this project

[] FineTune Flan T5 small with the same dataset (without using duel-adapters method)

[] If not reproducing the results then debug duel adapters 

[] If it is reproducing good results then try the same with duel adapters
